Hello, this is a practice project working with Spotify API, React, and CSS for my 349 Frontend Engineering Class

I made this using an express server taken from Spotify's AUTH examples

and a React Frontend I created myself.

To start backend:

cd server & node app.js

To start frontend:

cd client & npm start

In the future, I would like to move the react functions and other calls into the backend in order to create a more "black-box" app.

Also would like to start hosting these type of websites online.

Thanks for reading, Aban Domingo.
